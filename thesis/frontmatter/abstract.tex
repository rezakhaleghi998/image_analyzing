This thesis explores advanced image analysis techniques for computer vision applications, with a specific focus on developing robust algorithms for image processing, feature extraction, and object detection tasks. As visual data continues to grow exponentially in both volume and importance across numerous domains, the need for sophisticated computational methods to analyze and extract meaningful information from images has become increasingly critical.

The research presents a comprehensive framework for addressing complex image analysis challenges through a combination of classical computer vision techniques and modern deep learning approaches. By leveraging recent advancements in convolutional neural networks and transfer learning, this work demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Experiments conducted on multiple datasets show that the proposed methodologies achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and feature extraction. The implementation details and results are thoroughly documented through Jupyter notebooks that provide transparent and reproducible analysis pipelines.

The findings contribute to the field of computer vision by offering novel approaches to common challenges in image analysis and by providing empirical evidence for the effectiveness of hybrid methodologies that combine traditional image processing with deep learning techniques. The practical applications of this research extend to various domains including medical imaging, autonomous systems, industrial inspection, and multimedia content analysis.
